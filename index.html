      <h3>General Info:</h3>
      <p>
        I'm Andrew, a 27 year old Digital Project Manager from Manchester. I've
        always been interested in technology, hence my career path, and over the
        years of working as a PM I began to realise that the more I understood
        about the technical side, the better I'd be as a PM, so I've been
        learning as much as possible ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently enrolled on a Software Engineering bootcamp with
        Manchester Codes in my spare time, where I'm learning the following;
